The following is an archive of a weekly newsletter I sent out for five weeks in
September/October 2015. I laid out the reasons for stopping the newsletter again
in a [short blog post](/2015/12/15/farewell-leaders-digest/).

* [Leader's Digest #1 - Host Leadership](issue-1-host-leadership.html)
* [Leader's Digest #2 - Why do you want to lead people?](issue-2-why-do-you-want-to-lead-people.html)
* [Leader's Digest #3 - Five years, building a culture, and handing it off.](issue-3-five-years-building-a-culture-handing-it-off.html)
* [Leader's Digest #4 - How to Be a Great Software Development Manager](issue-4-how-to-be-a-great-software-development-manager.html)
* [Leader's Digest #5 - What is Leadership?](issue-5-what-is-leadership.html)


In case you're interested in the links I planned to send out with the
newsletter, take a look at the [public Trello
board](https://trello.com/b/XDwWieJY/leader-s-digest) that I used to gather
links and keep track of prepared and sent-out the newsletters.
