Hi everyone & Welcome to Leader's Digest #2!

This issue is all about "why":

**Why do you want to lead people?**  
[http://fractio.nl/2014/10/03/why-do-you-want-to-lead-people/](http://fractio.nl/2014/10/03/why-do-you-want-to-lead-people/)

There was a time when I thought that one has to have goals in order to make
meaningful progress, no matter which area. Of course it had to be SMART Goals.
Over the last two years though, I've revised that view.

I now think that you need to have a clear idea of "why" you're doing the things
you're doing. This is especially true for leaders and managers, as their team
members are evaluating their every action constantly, and over time develop a
clear compass for what is authentic for their leaders and what's not.

But that's actually not the most relevant reason for reflecting on the "why" of
your job. From my point of view, knowing what's your motivation behind your work
is an integral part of being happy with your work.

And, can't decide if that's more important, that makes you more effective.
Knowledge about and following your motivation leads to better work results.

So my suggestion is: Take your time, and think about why you're doing your
specific work.

Lindsay Holmwood's excellent article can help you with that. Not only because it
provides some common motivations, on why people move into management. It also
demonstrates what a thoughtful analysis of your motivations and thoughts can
look like.
But be sure to not stop at what Lindsay provides as possible motivations, and
dig deeper.

Happy reading!
