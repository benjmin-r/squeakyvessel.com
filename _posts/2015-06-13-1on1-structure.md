*This is a continuation of my previous post, in which I covered [the goals and
purposes of One on One Meetings][1on1-purpose]*

Over the course of those last two years, I found a structure for having 1on1
meetings that helps me a lot to get the most of these meetings, and which also
helped to make 1on1s a deeply ingrained part of vaamo's tech team culture.

### Structure 

All of the below elements, can be used on their own. 

If you're starting out doing 1on1s with your team, I suggest you start out with
one element only and over time add more elements.  
They're ordered in a way that each element builds upon the previous ones and
expands them in a sensible way.

### Prepare - Choose a Theme

While some posit that 1on1s are [the employee's
meeting][what-to-expect-employee] and I'd generally agree with that statement,
it's your job as manager to have your team member's back and make sure the
1on1 is useful in any case.

By that I mean, you should at every point in the 1on1 be able to take the lead
and steer the meeting into a direction that's useful to you and your team
member. Proper preparation can enable you do to that.

What worked very well for me, to set a theme beforehand. Think of a theme that
gives you both valuable insights.  
Have you talked about how the team could improve lately? Do you know who your
team member thinks is doing a great job on the team? Why? Do you know what they
think of your management style? Do you know where they'd like to be supported
more?

Having this regular direct line to your team is a powerful tool to get an
intimate view into the opinions of your whole team. In my recent experience, it
was immensely helpful to know what made everyone on the team feel productive, by
asking everyone in their respective 1on1 the same set of question, which was
"Do you feel productive in your day to day work? What makes you feel
productive?". The answers enabled profound changes and increased happiness
across the team, and event after quite some time now still prove very helpful in
designing processes.

Jason Evanish has an [exhaustive list of questions for 1on1s][101-questions] and
popforms even [provides a service][1on1-q-newsletter] to deliver a set of
matching inspirational questions to to your and your team member's mailbox at a
specified interval.


#### Listen

This is somewhat an antithesis to the previous structuring element, but
nevertheless very important.

#### Status Update

on the team members' views, feelings and, let's be honest, projects

Everybody says "don't use 1on1s for status updates". But sometimes that's status
is the thing that's on everyone's mind, so it's simply not practical to not
exchange that update. The most sensible thing you can do, is to make that update
useful. Which in my experience is done by limiting the time you spent with this
update and by getting the unique perspective of your countepart on the subject.


#### Conclude with Something Actionable

The temptation is high to end the meeting, when you both feel there's nothing
left to say. You possibly exchanged your views, at least you listened and
deepened your understanding of some area. You're feeling all fuzzy, because
everything's great. You're awesome, your team member is awesome. And that's it.

No! Don't do that.

Take those extra 5 minutes if you will and decide together what the next action
for each or both of you should be. How can each of you make the next minor step
to improve one of the possibly many topics that was touched upon in that
specific 1on1?

Ending the 1on1 with some concrete actions, something that you can both be held
accountable to, is super important. Because it will bring constant progress into
your relationship with your team member. It will be one of the most natural
things for both of you, that you keep on making things better for both of you.

#### Use the Rhythm


### Hot Topic: How long is a 1on1?

One of the minor but constantly asked-first questions about 1on1s is about the
length of the meeting. "How much time should we spend on the 1on1?"
