I've been leading teams for little over seven years now. Almost right from the
beginning of that time I reserved timeslots, to sit regularly & privately with
each of my team members. My motivation back then was to give every team member a
regular opportunity to tell me what's bothering them. 

Looking back, that motivation was deeply rooted in the most common emotion I had
in my job at the time, and which I assumed all others had too: Frustration.

I assumed what people needed most was a place to vent ([thanks rands, for that
nice word][rands-vent]) and the feeling of being heard. It took me some time to
realize I wasn't using that private time with my team members to it's fullest
potential.

Since I started working at my current role (ed. CTO of fintech startup vaamo) two years
ago, I started to give the purpose and structure of those private meetings more
thought. You could say, I started doing 1on1s according to a currently
predominant definition[^1].

Below, and in a follow-up post, I'll share what set of goals and which structure
for 1on1s worked well for me.


### Purpose

Ask a manager what they think are the goals of 1on1s and you get a different
answer everytime. This one is probably no different.

For me the purposes of 1on1s are manifold, but they all revolve around: **Create
trust!** Between you and your team member.

#### Build a relationship

Trust can only exist in a relationship. So, the first step towards building
trust is building a real relationship with your team member. One where you're
really interested in the opinions and feelings of the other person, and not the
least the person itself.

Actually, in the beginning I thought 1on1s were about having a deeper, real,
human relationship with the members of your team.

And while of course this is not wrong, it's not the whole story. After a while,
I realized, that the purpose of having this relationship is to put you, both
yourself and your team member, into a position where you can trust each other.


#### Provide a safe space 

Over time, trusting each other will turn into something really beautiful: Your
1on1s will become a safe space. Again, for both of you.

This safe space will enable both of you to bring up every topic you chose. It
will enable you to sometimes give the inevitable not-so-positive feedback that
your team member should hear. And it enables your team member to do the same. To
tell you when they think some things aren't the way they should be.

Having this safe space, puts you in a position to fix problems when they're
still small. Instead of having to fight those big fires that can bring on a lot
of trouble.


#### Long-term Goals and Career Development

Having a safe space and trusting each other is the perfect foundation to talk
about the long-term goals and the ways your team member wishes to develop their
career.

And you should use that foundation. It is a powerful building block of making
your team member happier, making sure they feel they make progress toward
something that's meaningful for them in the long run. 

In the end, also towards retaining them as a member of your team.


#### Continuous Improvement

Once you care about the long-term and career development of your team members,
you'll need to make progress on it.

[Not only, because of the Progress Principle][hbr-small-wins]:

> By supporting progress in meaningful work, managers improve employees’ inner
  work lives and the organization’s performance.

There's nothing that boosts your team members' happiness and productivity more
then perceived progress, no matter how minor.

This means, one goal of your 1on1s should be to enable continuous improvement
and progress. Your 1on1s can be the rhythm that will make progress and
improvement come almost naturally.


#### Give Feedback

I've stated it above already, but this deserves to stand on it's own. 

One goal of your 1on1s should be to give honest feedback to your team member.
Simple as that.

Why in a 1on1 and not during your normal working day? Because there are more
than enough reasons and circumstances where it's not appropriate to give
feedback right away. Be it, that your team member might feel embarassed by the
feedback, or that you simply don't feel there's enough time right at this moment
to give the feedback fully and properly.


### Structure

I'll share a structure of 1on1s in my next post. You could say, *my way* of
doing 1on1s.

... *to be continued*.
