summary: "In order to make it easier to get inspired by other companies' engineering ladders, I decided to put together a complete list of all published engineering ladders."
---

Sometime in summer 2015, when preparing yearly feedbacks for [my team at
vaamo][codecraft], I started formulating our team's (engineering) ladder. Back
then the concept of a ladder, the act of spelling out what the requirements and
expectations for a specific role and position are, was pretty new to me. Still
it immediately appealed to me.

The first ladder I came across was [Rent the Runway's][rtr] [Engineering
Ladder][rtr-ladder] as shared by [RTR's CTO-at-the-time Camille
Fournier][skamille].

And while working on vaamo's ladder I came across many more ladders, many of
them inspired by RTR's ladder, or inspired to be shared by RTR's sharing.

After a while, keeping tabs on all those published ladders became nearly
impossible. Yet, I found it very inspiring and helpful to have a list of
resources in the spirit of _"that's how others do it"_, in order to pick and
choose what works best for our case.

So in order to make it easier to get inspired by other companies' engineering
ladders, I decided to put together a complete list of all published engineering
ladders.

When using any of the below ladders as a starting point, be aware, that you'll
need quite a bit of effort to adapt and develop your own understanding of what
the roles' and positions' classifications mean for you and your organization.


### Ladders

If you're aware of a ladder, that's shared somewhere but not on this list,
please [contact me](/contact/) or [send a pull request][github-source].


<a name="rtr-ladder"></a>

#### [Rent the Runway][rtr-ladder]

When looking at some of the other ladders, this is the one that kicked off many
if not most of them to be shared.

I find it very well structured, approachable and it reveals deep thinking behind
it. I especially liked the concept of the four pillars _"Technical Skill"_,
_"Get Stuff Done"_, _"Impact"_, _"Communication & Leadership"_.


<a name="artsy-ladder"></a>

#### [Artsy][artsy-ladder]

The ladder from Arty's team, as shared by their [CTO Daniel
Doubrovkine][dblockdotorg] has a much simpler structure than the RTR ladder,
even though it says it's much inspired by it.


<a name="travis-ladder"></a>

#### [Travis CI][travis-ladder-slides]

The newest ladder on this list, was only introduced on 24-Jun-2016 at
[RedDotRubyConf in Singapur][travis-ladder-video] by [Travis CI's CTO Konstantin
Haase][konstantinhaase].

While the ladder itself is not overly prominent in the slidedeck and video, the
reasoning and story behind the compensation framework, which is based on the
ladder, is very interesting.


<a name="kickstarter-ladder"></a>

#### [Kickstarter][kickstarter-ladder]

Kickstarter's engineering ladder, as shared by [James Turnbull][kartar], features
paths for Technical and Data people as well as People Management roles.

Each role and position, up to the CTO, is described in helpful and concise
prose.


<a name="urbanairship-ladder"></a>

#### [Urban Airship][urbanairship-ladder]

Urban Airship's ladder covers engineers' and operations' paths as well as the
respective manager ladders.

Similar to [RTR's ladder][rtr-ladder], Urban Airship's organizes the
expectations towards each engineering and ops level around the concept of four
pillars, namely _"Domain Knowledge"_, _"Teaching and Mentoring"_, _"Culture and
Leadership"_ and _"Customer Success"_. Notice the absence of anything
"Technical" from this list of pillars.  
Management positions are described using three pillars _"Scope and Impact"_,
_"Team Development"_ and _"Customer Success"_.


<a name="intent-ladder"></a>

#### [Intent Media][intent-ladder]

Intent Media divides it's engineering organization into three paths, namely
_"Team Contributor"_, _"Technical Leadership"_ and _"Engineering Management"_.

It provides a lot of context about how engineering in general is structured at
Intent Media and all positions are described in a concise yet extensive prose.
It's very well structured, offers a lot of inspiration and conveys deep thinking
that lead towards the ladder.


<a name="chartbeat-ladder"></a>

#### [Chartbeat][chartbeat-ladder]

Chartbeat's ladder is also built around four pillars, namely
_"Responsibilities"_, _"Expertise"_, _"Qualities"_ and _"Objectives"_.
Furthermore it's actually three different ladders for the paths _Backend_,
_Frontend/Design_ and _Data Science_.

The descriptions are very compact, thus require probably quite some effort in
communicating and to create a shared understanding. Which of course is not
necessarily a bad thing, as it's nearly impossible to formulate a ladder that
doesn't trigger or even requires a discussion around it's assumptions and
definitions.


<a name="spotify-ladder"></a>

#### [Spotify][spotify-ladder2]

Spotify [documented their way][spotify-ladder1] to something like an engineering
ladder, then wrote about [how the v1.0 looks like][spotify-ladder2] and lastly
[shared their lessons learned and surprises][spotify-ladder3] while introducing
the ladder.

Very interesting and comprehensive read and bonus points for providing a very
different approach to an engineering ladder, than most others in this list.

[HT to Robert][robert-spotify-share] for sharing these links with me.


<a name="charles-ladder"></a>

#### [Charles Krempeaux][charles-ladder]

[Charles][reiver] is CTO at [Koho](https://www.koho.ca/) and shared his ladder.
_"His"_ in the sense of "no company is specifically mentioned in the blog post".

It's extra helpful, as it contains specific reasoning in which circumstances
titles are helpful or maybe even necessary, and why it's a bad idea to have
a ladder where the top technical level is something like "Senior Software
Engineer".


<a name="fogcreek-ladder"></a>

#### [Fog Creek][fogcreek-ladder]

Honorary mention for the infamous ladder by Joel Spolsky which dates back to the
year 2009 and is probably one of the first publicly shared engineering ladders.

Compared to the more recently shared ladders, it has a completely different
approach and is the only one in this list, where "years of experience" is
a measure of sorts. Which in my opinion, simply isn't appropriate anymore. Go
watch [Konstantin's explanation](https://youtu.be/N8u9H6JDAzo?t=18m51s) of how
a better way to think about an employee's value contribution to a company looks
like.

So just to be clear: Don't base your ladder this one, as there are better ways
to arrive at compensation levels than "years of experience".


<a name="capgemini-ladder"></a>

#### [Cap Gemini][capgemini-ladder]

> Last year, we identified a need to redefine the career framework for our
> software engineers within the UK engineering teams and started work on a
> Capgemini Software Engineering grade ladder. The grade ladder is our team’s
> self-produced documentation to enable everyone, both inside and outside our
> team, to understand our ethos and values and what’s expected of them.

<a name="patreon-ladder"></a>

#### [Patreon][patreon-ladder]

> Today we are excited to share Patreon’s revamped Engineering Leveling Guide. In Patreon’s early years, we had little in the way of objective criteria for leveling engineers. We’ve come a long way since then, and our engineering organization is much stronger and fairer for it. We want to show you how we define levels now and what it’s like to work at Patreon.
