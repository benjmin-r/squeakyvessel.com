Some time ago, as I started to spend more time on [growing our tech team at
vaamo](http://codecraft.vaamo.de/jobs/) again, I realized that I had put off one
thing for much too long already: Defining and really putting down my definition
of maturity and technical leadership in software teams.

In order to get this finally sorted out, I'll lay out the aspects that together
from a mature developer.

### What Defines Mature Developers?

An engineer's maturity is mainly defined by their soft-skills, less so by their
technical abilities and knowledge.

For one, everybody who shows most of the following characteristics is very
likely smart enough to gather enough technical skills by simple exposure to
experience over time.

Another assumption underlying this postulate also being, that it's very unlikely
for a person to combine most of the mentioned maturity traits without going
through some years of working in teams. Mind you, not necesarily software
development or operations teams. Actually any half-way creative work will
probably allow a mindful person to evolve their relevant soft-skills.

But what actually are those characteristics, soft-skills?


#### Mindfulness

Mindfulness is a simple practice that can be described as paying attention to
what is going on in the moment, without judgment.

And I strongly believe there's a correlation between one’s ability and willingness
to pay attention and to self-reflect and their ability to improve.

So one of the first and most important qualities of mature developers is they're
more often than not paying attention to what is going on around them. They're
deliberately taking their time to observe before proceeding (put succinctly as
STOP, Stop, Take a breath, Observe, Proceed).

Mature developers are being mindful about themselves and their surrounding, in
order to be able to always keep improving their own work and approaches.

Mindfulness sooner or later leads mature developers to become aware of, learn
about [cognitive biases][cognitive-biases] and find ways to handle them.


#### Curiousity

Technology work is creative work. And I simply can't imagine someone being good
at it, by any measure, without being curious. Curious about the surrounding
technology, about how things work, about why things are they way they are etc
etc.

And this curiousity should not diminish over time. Rather it should always grow
alongside maturity, as one is exposed to more problems, technologies and people
over time.

And it's also important that this curiousity is not limited to technical topics
only. [Mature developers are curious about people, how they tick, what's
interesting to them and much more][skamille-curiousity].


#### Pragmatism

The necessary counter-balance for curiousity then is pragmatism. As one is
curious about almost anything, they usually need to choose quickly about what's
important and when it's important.

More generally, a pragmatic engineer weighs possible options in terms of
long-term impact and costs vs short-term benefits.


#### Pro-Activeness

Personally my first and still trusted indicator of a good engineer is
pro-activeness.

Someone that's pro-active, who communicates early & often, who seeks out risks,
who sees chances way before they are obvious for others, can help a team succeed
much faster and more easily.


#### Having and Sharing a Technical Vision

Where should the systems that people are working on should lead to? How do you
know it's a success? What's there to do beyond the obvious stuff that's needed
to get features out the door in the next three months and what's the thinking
and reasoning behind those visionary aspects?

Not the least part of having this technical vision is then also to actually
share it with relevant people. Ideally with anybody who is even remotely
involved in working with or shaping the system in the future.  This means people
like product managers etc should also know about the vision.

Sharing the vision with other involved parties not only serves as a perfect
opportunity for practicing one's skills to explain deeply technical terms and
circumstances with non-technical people. It also serves the purpose to validate
the vision in terms of relevance to business value and other aspects.


#### Understanding Business Value

Mature developers know and understand at every turn, that everything they do
serves the purpose of providing value to someone else, most of the times some
kind of business.

They're able to put everything they do into a greater context and understand how
their current and future actions play out into this context.

Because of that they can assume the positions of non-technical people much more
easily. Which in turn enables them to communicate and explain their actions and
motivations more easily and usually concisely to non-technical people, and
reduces friction when working with non-technical people.


#### Reasonable Risk-taking

Putting their actions and plans into a bigger, non-technical context also
enables mature developers to better assess risks. For example, does the risk of
introducing a new technology possibly outweigh the business benefits that are to
be expected?

Assessing and understanding risks better puts them into a position where it's
also more likely they'll actually take risks. Risks that without the knowledge
about business value and the bigger context may look to big to be worthwhile.
But not for mature developers who are able to see beyond the obvious risks and
include more aspects into their judgement.


#### Empathy

Empathy really is one of my favourite words and concepts.

Without empathy you cannot be effective or even successful in working together
with others. You need to be empathic to resolve more conflicts than you create
and therefore providing value to and with others.

Empathy enables understanding others’ goals. Together

XXX work further on this.

Understand goals of others
Real interest in getting to know their peers

they know how frustration and happiness for 
Putting conscious effort into getting to know others is crucial for
this.


#### Excellent Communicator

I've touched on mature developers being good communicators earlier already, but
of course this deserves to stand on it's own.

Mature developers communicate excellently by always taking the context of their
communicating peers into account. They know or at least have a sense about their
counterpart's goals, their state of mind, sometimes maybe even the mood they're
in, and how their peers usually communicate. 

This allows them to consistently control the way they communicate with others.
Does my counterpart need a direct and quick answer, or do they want to
understand the surrounding details? Do they want a short answer now, but more
info later on? Is it useful for my and my counterpart's goals to take a more
defensive stance right now, in order to relax a situation?

Put simply: Always know what your counterparts need and want to know. And
deliver it.

XXX communicate assumptions they've made. See "decisiveness", SW dev is
making & documenting decisions. Not all decisions can be based on experience or
real data, therefore assumptions need to be made

xxx assumptions also related to risk-taking, mature eng are risk takers, that
are also comfortable with making assumptions, but always knowing that they must
communicate them, so that others have a as complete as possible picture of what
they're talking about

#### Decisiveness

XXX reference @tottinge's mail ... they need to make decissions on incomplete
data, intuition. They must be comfortable with that


### Other Opinions

As with most things, many people have come before me and shared their view and
they influenced my thinking or helped me shape my own way.

And rather than thinking my definition above is new or novel, you can view it as
a prioritized extract and sometimes slight rewording of those originals.  So
when describing my own understanding in the above paragraphs I haven't pointed
to the exact references anymore. I'll leave it to the interested reader as an
exercise to find out where exactly I copied from.

The most comprehensive and absolute must-read on the topic is [John
Allspaw](https://twitter.com/jallspaw)'s ["On being a Senior
Engineer"][senior-engineer]. It's not only a testament to an amazing amount of
clear thinking on behalf of the author, but is amazingly comprehensive and
already an timeless classic.

Some much more recent pieces on the topic of Tech Leads such as ["Good Tech
Lead, Bad Tech Lead"][good-bad-tech-lead], ["No Tech Lead"][no-tech-lead], ["10
Reasons You Shouldn’t Have Senior Developers, Tech Leads or
Architects"][10-reasons] provided inspiration.

As well loads of very good reads from [Kate Madsudeira][katemats] as well her
timeless [talk on leveling up your engineering and operations
role][leveling-up].

Of course, many more opinions, such as talking with my colleague
[Timo](https://twitter.com/timohirt), with members of the local
[Softwerkskammer][swkrm] and at many a [SoCraTes conferences][socrates],
influenced my thinking, but those are the most prominent ones.
