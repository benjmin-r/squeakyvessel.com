<p>That's what I heard over and over again in the last days. The days, where I
  really tried to apply <a
    href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique">the Pomodoro
    Technique</a>.</p>

<p>So as a proper geek I <a href="http://onethingwell.org/tagged/timers">looked
    for timing tools</a> that can be keyboard controlled, for easy triggering
  new time slots.</p>

<h3>pom + Alfred</h3>

<p>I stumbled across several tools, but stuck to <a href="https://github.com/tobym/pom">pom</a> quikly. Pom is a very simple shell script, which (literally) tells you that your time is over. Actually the title of this blog post are the exact words pom made my mac say to me after each timer run.</p>

<p>I had to <a href="https://github.com/{{ site.github_username }}/pom">tweak it a little</a>
  to make the timer length configurable. But after that it worked nicely and
  with a little help of <a href="http://www.alfredapp.com/">Alfred</a> it was
  pretty easy to trigger timers.</p>

<h3>Vitamin-R</h3>

<p>After <a
    href="https://twitter.com/benjamin/status/301324293114056705">tweeting</a>
  about my initial frustration or rather confusion in applying the technique, a
  small discussion with <a href="https://twitter.com/jbrains">@jbrains</a>
  emerged after which <a
    href="https://twitter.com/jbrains/status/301385039520862208">he
    recommended</a> <a
    href="http://www.publicspace.net/Vitamin-R/">Vitamin-R</a>. I only took a
  5-minute look at the tool, and found it much too complex for my needs. Maybe,
  when I'm more strict in my use of the technique I need a more complex
  tool.<br /> But right now I just want to be reminded that my timebox is over,
  and I should consider stopping my work now or deliberately choose to continue
  for another timebox.</p>

<h3>Tadam</h3>

<p>And after having used the above pom/Alfred setup for three days <a
    href="http://onethingwell.org/post/43154397018/tadam">onethingwell</a>
  writes about <a href="http://tadamapp.com/">Tadam</a>. Which turns out is
  exactly what I wanted. Take a look at it</p>
