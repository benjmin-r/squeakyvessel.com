It's been quite a ride, the last four years. 

Almost exactly four years ago, on the 14th of January 2013, I met [Oliver
Vins](https://twitter.com/revilo1976) at [#wmfra](http://wmfra.de). He was not
one to overlook, as he wore a bright yellow T-Shirt proclaiming that he and his
co-founders were looking for a CTO to join their, then-to-be-founded, startup
[vaamo][vaamo-de].

On that evening I never expected to actually work with them, much less spend the
longest time yet at a job, at that company, with Oliver and
[Thomas](https://twitter.com/BankDerZukunft) (the other co-founder).

Still, that's what happened and looking back, it was one of the best decisions
I've made in my life.  
For the last four years I've been the CTO of vaamo. In that role I've been
privileged to work with the brightest, kindest and most awesome people I've ever
met and worked with. Together we've built a robust and scalable company and
product, while never losing our kindness and respect for the fact that we're all
humans. I'm incredibly proud to have helped shape a company and culture that
keeps on delivering with a sense of calmness and humanity.  
Looking back it was my first "real" management job, and I'm incredibly lucky and
happy that Thomas and Oliver trusted me and gave me the opportunity to be part
of and shape that roller-coaster-ride that is a technology startup.

Then again, after such a long time (long for me) I feel it's time to do
something different. And [so][so]: I'm open for new roles and opportunities in
the next months.


<a name="whatsnext"></a>

## What's next?

Currently I'm quite open about where I am going next. Freelance or permanent
position. Both is possible.

I can imagine to join a company in a permanent role, and I think some of the
below described aspired roles, are likely only available in permanent positions.

Then again, when it comes to company culture and degrees of freedom offered in
a position, vaamo set a very high bar for any future job of mine.
So I can imagine to take on freelance/contract work for the foreseeable future,
if a fitting permanent role is not in sight.

All that said: [Contact me](/contact) if you think my skills and strengths could
help you. Whether it's freelance work or a permanent position, we'll work out
the details while talking.

## What I'm good at

<a name="goodattech"></a>

### Technology

Technology-wise I've always been and still am a generalist. I've worked on
a wide range of products, in different roles and several industries. I have
strong opinions, that are weakly held, about how to do Frontend as well as
Backend development, and also how to operate software in production.

Through my more than 15 years experience in tech, I've acquired the ability to
quickly and intuitively grasp a breadth of situations and can usually assess
ways to move forward reliably.
This served me especially well, in roles where I was at the intersection of tech
and business, which roughly was the last eight years of my career.

And just to be clear: Yes, I can code. And I still code. That is, if you're
looking for a very experienced developer, who contributes code and goes beyond,
then let's talk.

<a name="goodatpeople"></a>

### People

People first, all else will follow.

I care about people. I care about people to bring their best self to work, if
they choose to. I care that every person in a team is able to contribute
according to their strengths. I care about helping people grow, be it their
career and skills, their contentment, their happiness or whatever they choose.

Also I'm good at listening. To what peers and customers are saying, then
tailoring solutions to their actual needs. That usually means I bring people
together, facilitate discussions and help people reach meaningful conclusions
and decisions.

## What's important to me

<a name="importanttomepeople"></a>

### People

And: People.

I believe, one of the reasons I consider myself "good" at working with
people is, that the people I work with are important to me.

That means, I'll patiently point it out, whenever you use the word "resource"
when you're actually talking about a group of people. So, when you see people
only as a means to get a job done, and not as the actual goal, then we're
probably not a good fit. If it's not in your genuine interest to make the life's
of those around you better, then we'll probably not work together for long.


<a name="importanttomefreedom"></a>

### Freedom to choose time & place to work

I'm a dad to two wonderful children, and a husband to an amazing teacher and
school vice-principal. That means I got responsibilities, in addition to my
professional work. In order to fulfil my duties and responsibilities
adequately, I need a certain degree of freedom when it comes to where and when
I do my work.  


<a name="importanttomediversity"></a>

### Diversity

I think the tech industry is broken with regards to, how it knowingly (and
unknowingly) excludes larger groups of people, based on stereotypes, biases and
seemingly "best practices".

This does not mean, I don't want to work with you, if your code fails the
[Bechdel-Test][bechdel]. Rather it's important to me, that people I work with
are willing to reflect their own behaviour critically, and how they might be
part in excluding people. And in the end change that behaviour.

## What I would love to do

<a name="buildingteams"></a>

### Building Teams

One of the greatest joys in the last years was my work to build a team, to find
people to join the team and work with all of them to make it the best team they
can imagine.

And I'd love to help others do similar things. That means, working on the
intersection of HR and tech. Helping grow scalable teams. By finding and hiring
the right talent and helping to shape meaningful practices and team culture.
A culture that not only puts the people's talent to their best use, but also
makes it the best place to work for the people on the team.

I can imagine doing this in a supporting role, as a consultant. And I can
imagine making this my main focus of my work at a company, that's growing its
team and wants to ensure the longevity of its measures.

### Tech Evangelism, Developer Relations

Through my work at vaamo and my involvement in several communities, before and
while being CTO, I've really enjoyed bringing people together. The actual team
at vaamo of course, but also reaching out to people outside the company,
connecting with a broad range of communities. Putting together groups that as
a whole are better than their sum of its parts. Most of the time while doing
that, bringing together such groups, I've observed the side-effect that people
discover new ways to grow, that have been unknown to them before.

And while I haven't held a position like Developer Relations and activities such
as Evangelism/Advocacy/etc were only a small part of what I did as vaamo's CTO,
I enjoyed this part of the work immensely.

That's why I'd be excited to help a company or team reach out to and become
a part of the wider tech community (or a specific subgroup).
