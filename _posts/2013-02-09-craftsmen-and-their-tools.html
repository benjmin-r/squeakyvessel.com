<p>To start my blog off just right, I thought I'll take an especially nice topic: The tool metaphor as it's often used in the Software Craftsmanship community!</p>
<p>When people talk about Software Craftsmanship it usually doesn't take long for the tool metaphor to come up. Just yesterday, <a href="http://www.shino.de/">Markus Gärtner</a> tweeted the following</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Like a craftsman can choose which hammer to use, people in the software world should pick their own tools as they see fit. &mdash; Markus Gärtner (@mgaertne) <a href="https://twitter.com/mgaertne/status/299431620270759936">February 7, 2013</a></p>

<p>Sounds very reasonable at first glance.</p>
<p>Craftsmen are usually proud of their tool mastery, and it's considered rude to question the Craftsman's choice of tools. <em>Hey, we know what we are doing!</em></p>
<p>However in some software projects, especially in large enterprise projects, it's quite common, that a certain set of tools is set in stone from the get-go<sup id="fnref-97:1"><a href="1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. So proper Software Craftsmen are usually offended that they're not allowed to use "the best tool for the job" in such projects. Sometimes even the professionalism of these projects is questioned.</p>
<p>While my general sentiment is with Markus' above statement, I find it harmful to stress this metaphor too strongly.<br />
Because it's basically comparing apples to oranges.</p>
<p>Whenever a carpenter chooses a hammer for a task, his/her choice is easily revertible and has no long-term effects, apart from the end-product's quality.</p>
<p>In software projects however, a tool choice can have very profound and long-lasting consequences, and is usually not easily revertible.<br />
One of the most basic decisions in a software project, is the programming languages used. And this is unquestionably a decision that's one of the hardest to revert.</p>
<p>Think a little about it, the next time you tell colleagues or an audience about the "right tool for the job" and how Craftsmen should always be able to choose their tools.</p>
