**TL;DR This site will not be updated anymore. I now write and podcast at [cto.coffee][cto.coffee].**

It's not a coincidence, that the [latest post][event-announce] on squeakyvessel is more than 15 months ago. And even
then it was more of an event announcement than actual content (btw the workshop was great üéµ).

Because, since that time I started a podcast with the title [cto.coffee][podcast], where I talk about humans in tech with
varying guests. In the latest episode I talk about ‚ÄúSymbolic & Observational Thinking‚Äù with [Yulia
Startsev][ioctaptceb].

Plus, recently I also started [writing][writing] on the same site, the first article being about [how
one can lead without formal authority][1st-post].

So, if you want to keep up to date with my writing or are interested in listening to a podcast, then head over to
[cto.coffee][cto.coffee], as this site will most likely not be maintained with newer content in a while. üôÇ
