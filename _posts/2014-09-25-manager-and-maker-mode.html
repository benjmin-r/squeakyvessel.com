<p>I've been working as a manager of engineering teams for several years now. And one of the eternal struggles of switching from a developer to a management role, has been how to divide up my time between Maker and Manager mode.</p>
<p>Which in turn means I think and read a lot about it. When I come across some blog post about how person xyz does it, you can be sure I'll read it.</p>
<h3>One way of looking at it ...</h3>
<p>So when <a href="http://blog.newrelic.com/2014/03/11/sxsw-coding-ceo-recap/">New Relic wrote about how their CEO tackled it</a> several months ago, I read it. And it stuck with me. Or rather it bothered me. I was all like "man, this CEO has this strategy and I have a problem with it, so obviously I'm the problem". Which of course is not true. It's never about right or wrong with those types of things. Still, I couldn't quite figure out what it was, that I couldn't simply nod my head in agreement while reading the article.</p>
<p>The strategies highlighted in the blog post, are all pretty solid. Except, the detailed description of "#3 Focus on high-value projects.". That one still bugs me. The point itself is of course valid. If you're a manager, a CEO even, then make your work count.</p>
<h3>Another Perspective</h3>
<p>But how I understand it, the article suggests, the manager who wants to keep coding, should pick high-profile, high-stakes projects when he gets to code.</p>
<p>And this is fundamentally wrong in my opinion.</p>
<p>I think the managers that need to or just want to keep fresh on their technical skills, should rather pick out the mundane grunt work. Stuff that <a href="https://twitter.com/skamille">Camille Fournier</a> talks about in her recent <a href="http://youtu.be/jGPrU15GuSw">Velocity NYC keynote</a> when she says "Be a Squeaky Wheel, and Bring Oil". Sahil Lavingia says the same in <a href="https://medium.com/@shl/write-code-sometimes-e7516c2b1f71">"Write code. Sometimes."</a> at the end with "Everyone else is busy. I get to save them time [...]".</p>
<p><a href="http://lnbogen.com/">Oren Ellenbogen</a> devoted a whole chapter of his book <a href="http://leadingsnowflakes.com/">Leading Snowflakes</a> to this topic. Among others guidelines he recommends that the tasks you should work on in Maker mode should be small (less than 4h) and ideally boost other teammates' velocity.</p>
<h3>TL;DR</h3>
<p>I'm not saying that the described approach is a bad approach per se. I can imagine that Lew Cirne's approach really is helpful for innovation.</p>
<p>For me being a manager is about empowering (and of course some other equally important stuff) your people. And I can't imagine how locking yourself away for weeks, to crank out the next wave of innovative product, helps you with that.</p>
<p>So there it is. That's my problem with the article.</p>
