_TL;DR [register here](#register) for a free, evening-long, intro-level workshop "Live coding music with Sonic Pi"._

I've been [enjoying all kinds of music][music-tweet], basically all my life. But somehow I never considered myself
musical. I still somehow [tried to learn an instrument](/2015/01/20/my-goals-in-2015/) (with very little effort
actually going into that attempt), and failed. The barrier always seemed too high for me.

Even so, I couldn't really shake the longing for being able to create music. That's why the topic of _Programming Music_
and the respective tools, as it being the combination of two things I enjoy,  were something I tried to dip my toe into
for quite a while now. But they always seemed too intimidating, the concepts too daunting, to actually try them out.

But all that changed during an evening session at this year's [SoCraTes][socrates].

During the first day's session marketplace at the conference, I thought "fuck it, this is the safest space for me to
reveal how clueless I am about programming/making music". Which brought me to propose an evening session on _Programming
Music_. I introduced the session with something along the lines of "I have no clue, but I want to spend time on trying
out stuff, maybe others want to join me".

As to be expected at a SoCraTes event, the people who joined me were knowledgeable, eager to share and absolutely
wonderful, all at the same time. I went into the session with no knowledge about creating music and left having created some
tunes with Sonic Pi and with no fear to do more.

Since then I couldn't stop playing with Sonic Pi and learning more about music and music theory, which feels amazing.

And I now want to share that joy and show others, that the entry to creating music, being musical, is much lower than
you think. Especially with a tool such as Sonic Pi.

Which I'll do with this workshop and also at the [Ruby on Ice](https://rubyonice.com/2018/speakers/benjamin_reitzammer)
conference, which takes place from [26-28 January 2018 at beautiful lake Tegernsee](https://rubyonice.com/2018/about).

### Workshop

The workshop is titled _Live coding music with Sonic Pi_ and will contain a short introduction into Sonic Pi's
principles.

The majority of the workshop's time however will be you playing and creating music, experimenting with music and having
loads of fun. Trust me, after participating in this workshop you'll have a new hobby.
