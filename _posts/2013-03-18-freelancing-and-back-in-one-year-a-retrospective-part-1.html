<p>
  Almost exactly one year ago I started my freelancing business. It's been one
  of the best years of my life. Not only but in parts due to my freelancing.
  <br /> And not only but also because I'm stopping freelancing after a year
  already, I want to take the time and reflect on what happened, what worked and
  what didn't for me.<br /> (As I'm writing this, it turns out, there's rather
  much to reflect and tell, so I’ll turn this into a series).
</p>

<p>The preparations to go freelance of course started way before it actually happened.<br />
The business side prep started after I quit my full-time job some months before. The mind prep (including getting confident enough that I actually have something to sell and convincing myself and my wife that the risk involved is manageable and it's not just some kind of fluke I'm doing, but a serious thing I want to do) took several years. But relax, I won't bother with <em>all</em> these details. If you still want to know them, <a href="https://twitter.com/benjamin">buy me a beer</a>.</p>
<h3>My Goals for Freelancing</h3>
<p>One consequence of this prep was that I knew pretty well, what I wanted to achieve by going freelance. At least several people I talked to during this year said that. It seemed unusual that I knew exactly what my reasons and goals were for going freelance.<br />
(Sidenote: I prefer to say that I opened a business instead of going freelance)<br />
These goals were and are:</p>
<ul>
<li>I wanted to have a much greater freedom (compared to the standard German full-time job) when it comes to when and were I work. </li>
<li>I wanted to do more technical work. </li>
</ul>
<h3>Background: Why more Technical Work?</h3>
<p>I guess they are not uncommon and therefore pretty easy to understand. Still, to really understand the second goal a little background is necessary.<br />
After studying and getting my diploma I worked as a developer for several years. It was great. I had some interesting (though not overly awesome) projects. But I always thought that there should be more, and I always was one those “I want to do more, gimme more responsibilities” kind of guy. In retrospect, I totally was one of those Generation X people, that’s described in Theo Schlossnagle’s quote, which is at the beginning of John Allspaw’s brilliant <a href="http://www.kitchensoap.com/2012/10/25/on-being-a-senior-engineer/">“On being a Senior Engineer”</a> article.<br />
Besides making me restless, changing jobs quite often, or at least being on the lookout constantly, it also lead to getting a teamlead role someday. That was in 2008. At the time it felt like “FINALLY, I can do what I want and really do stuff I always wanted to do but no one ever let me”. Boy, was I clueless.</p>

<p>Still, or because of that, I learned loads in the following years. But it
  didn't take long for me to miss development, the actual hands-on coding. So
  instead of losing interest in technical stuff and focusing more on management
  topics, I tried to keep up-to-date with what happened technically, but of
  course lacked the actual day-to-day coding experience. Don't get me wrong; I
  enjoyed the people-part of my job. Really talking to people, being somehow
  “responsible” for them and trying to help them have a good job, trying to
  help them advance their skills and themselves. Doing stuff I’d today call
  coaching. I really enjoyed that, and still do.<br /> But still, that interest
  in everything technical never left or even got less. Quite the contrary it
  increased over time which lead me to goal no. 2 above. I wanted to bring my
  technical chops back to life and wanted to dig deep into code and other
  technical challenges.</p>

<p>So, how did I start working on achieving those goals? I'll write about that
  in the <a

    post of the series</a>.</p>
