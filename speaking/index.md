The following is a list of talks I gave at conferences and/or usergroups.

If you'd like me to speak about the below or other topics, you can [contact
me](/contact/)

## [How do Agile & Scrum affect Quality - A Reality-Check](/agile-scrum-quality-reality-check/)

The original question that lead to this talk was asked by [Marco
Klemm](https://twitter.com/marcoklemm), initiator and moderator of [Agile Nacht
Stuttgart](http://www.mitblick.de/agile-nacht-stuttgart). He asked
(paraphrased) "do Agile & Scrum really hold their promise of increasing
a project's quality"?.

In this short talk I present my personal opinion and the experience of my last
years as [CTO of
vaamo](http://codecraft.vaamo.de/2015/04/29/introducing-myself-benjamin.html)
argue, that while it's possible to employ practices such as Agile, Scrum
& Software Craftsmanship to increase the quality of software projects (for
varying degrees of quality), the actually important factors and the biggest
leverage to increase quality and success of projects, are the involved humans
and their way of interacting with each other.


## [5 Years of Software Craftsmanship](/5-years-of-software-craftsmanship/)

... a Personal Take on How To Write Software Better.

Practices, (Management) Frameworks and opinions on how software should be built
are as numerous as there are people on this planet.

A group of such opinions dubs itself Software Craftsmanship and calls for seeing
a software development more as a craft instead of an engineering discipline.

I count myself among the Software Craftsmanship community since 2011. Since then
I've been supporting and spreading the ideas of Software Craftsmanship. Be it by
organizing user groups and conferences, by giving talks or via the continuous
efforts incorporating Software Craftsmanship ideas and practices into my daily
work as developer and manager.

In this talk I'll look back over the last five years, the journey I've made as a
software developer and developer of teams. I'll share how my view on how to do
software development better changed over this time.


## [You're doing it wrong ...](/youre-doing-it-wrong/)

... *Why your technology stack doesn't matter for your product's success!*

In this talk I argue, that the information technology and especially the
software development industry enjoys to talk about their technology stacks and
programming languages a lot, and we attribute a lot of our success to these
technologies, we're really doing it wrong. And while we often pride ourselves in
using "the best tool for the job", I argue in this talk that the tool actually
plays only a minor role in the success of our products and projects.

Other factors, primarily the way we interact, treat each other and the
principles that form the basis of our interactions and work are far more
important to making our products successful.

I present the talk at the following conferences:

- [Topconf](http://topconf.com/linz-2016/trackevent/youre-doing-it-wrong-why-your-technology-stack-doesnt-matter-for-your-products-success/)
  in Linz, Austria on 3-Feb-2016


## [Innovation & Value with Scala, not because](/innovation-value-scala/)

The talk first covers how we made our [technology
choice](http://codecraft.vaamo.de/2014/09/12/our-technology-stack.html) in favor
of Scala. It continues to take a look at the wanted and unwanted consequences of
this choice and closes with my thoughts on how, if at all, it enabled the team
to deliver innovation and value to our business.

I present the talk at the following conferences:

- [XP Days
  Germany](http://www.xpdays.de/2015/sessions/101-innovation-value-mit-scala-nicht-wegen.html)
  in Karlsruhe on 26-Nov-2015
- [Voxxed
  Days](http://voxxeddaysberlin2016.sched.org/event/5DEX/innovation-value-with-scala-not-because)
  in Berlin on 28-Jan-2016
- [Entwicklertag
  Frankfurt](https://entwicklertag.de/frankfurt/2016/innovation-value-mit-scala-nicht-wegen)
  in Frankfurt on 10-Mar-2016


## [5 Leadership Hacks](/5-leadership-hacks/)

A talk I gave at [Entwicklertag
Frankfurt](https://entwicklertag.de/frankfurt/2015/5-leadership-hacks-oder-wie-ich-meine-ideen-umgesetzt-bekomme)
on 24th February 2015.

In the talk I describe five practices, that are directly applicable to a wide
range of teams and circumstances, which can help you lead others.

After describing those "hacks" I lay down the fundamentals of why those
practices work and how you can take your leadership skills to the next level.


## [Sane Secrets Sharing](/sane-secrets-sharing/)

A talk I gave in the Ignite format on 24th October 2014 at the [Berlin DevOps
Days](http://www.devopsdays.org/events/2014-berlin/).

In this talk I describe how we share secrets inside the
[vaamo](http://codecraft.vaamo.de) development & operations team, and how we
integrate them into our Chef-based Configuration Management.


## [Event Sourcing in der Praxis](https://github.com/Ookami86/event-sourcing-in-practice)

A talk about [Event Sourcing](http://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html)
I gave, together with [Johannes Seitz](http://www.printhelloworld.de/), at the
[Entwicklertag Frankfurt
2014](http://www.entwicklertag.de/frankfurt/2014/session/event-sourcing-der-praxis)
and the [Developer Week 2014](http://www.developer-week.de/History/2014)


## [Software Craftsmanship or The Agile Hangover](http://static.squeakyvessel.com/slides/what-is-software-craftsmanship_agilerm-ug-20120816.pdf)

A short talk I gave at the local Agile Usergroup on 16-Aug-2012

As the title may suggest, the talk was about Software Craftsmanship and what it
has to do with Agile in general. The outcome is more or less something like "you
need Software Craftsmanship, whether or not you want it and some of the things
you already do are very likely Software Craftsmanship-related".  
There was a lot of head-nodding from the audience, so I guess, they understood
what I was talking about

The [slides](http://static.squeakyvessel.com/slides/what-is-software-craftsmanship_agilerm-ug-20120816.pdf)
are pretty visual, though the (german) notes are very extensive.


## Architectural Katas

At the [2012 SoCraTes](http://www.socrates-conference.de/) I gave
two sessions about [Architectural Katas](http://www.architecturalkatas.com/).

The format was created initially by [Ted Neward](http://www.tedneward.com/) in
response to the lack of practical exercises for software architects. Small
groups solve a given project together (which is similar to a very simple RFP -
    Request for Proposal) in a short amount of time and present it to the other
groups afterwards to "defend" it.

Participants of both sessions were very surprised how hard it is to come up
with a meaningful (or even good) architecture in a short amount of time, and
even more so to convey it to other groups. They also acknowledged the usefulness
to practice this kind of architecting in addition to the usual coding
practices.

As far as I know, it was the first Architectural Kata held in germany.

Later that year, I also facilitated a Architectural Kata session at the
[XPDays DE conference](http://www.xpdays.de/twiki/bin/view/XPDays2012).


## Soziale Netze Integrieren

German talk, held at
[web-devcon](http://www.web-developer-conference.de/History/Programm-2011/Soziale-Netze-integrieren)
in Hamburg, Germany on 18-Dec-2011.

> APIs und Mashups sind alte Bekannte für beinahe jeden
> Web-Entwickler. Dennoch hat die Nutzung von APIs erst mit dem Erscheinen
> und dem Erfolg von Google, Twitter und Facebook, den bisher einzigen
> wirklichen "API Billionaires", so richtig begonnen. Die Integration von
> Social Networks mittels ihrer jeweiligen APIs gehört also in den
> Werkzeugkasten jedes ernstzunehmenden Web-Entwicklers. Dieser Vortrag
> behandelt, für was die APIs der Social Networks verwendet werden können,
> welche Herausforderungen bei der Nutzung der APIs bestehen, wie man mit
> Ihnen umgeht und wie am Ende die Architektur der eigenen Anwendung durch
> die Integration von APIs nicht unnötig belastet wird.
