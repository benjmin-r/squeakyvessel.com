The following is a (semi-) complete list of talks I gave at conferences
and/or usergroups.

If you'd like me to speak about the below or other topics, you can [contact
me](/contact/)


## [5 Leadership Hacks](/5-leadership-hacks/)

A talk I gave at [Entwicklertag
Frankfurt](https://entwicklertag.de/frankfurt/2015/5-leadership-hacks-oder-wie-ich-meine-ideen-umgesetzt-bekomme)
on 24th February 2015.

In the talk I describe five practices, that are directly applicable to a wide
range of teams and circumstances, which can help you lead others.

After describing those "hacks" I lay down the fundamentals of why those
practices work and how you can take your leadership skills to the next level.

## [Sane Secrets Sharing](/sane-secrets-sharing/)

A talk I gave in the Ignite format on 24th October 2014 at the [Berlin DevOps
Days](http://www.devopsdays.org/events/2014-berlin/).

In this talk I describe how we share secrets inside the
[vaamo](http://codecraft.vaamo.de) development & operations team, and how we
integrate them into our Chef-based Configuration Management.

## [Event Sourcing in der Praxis](https://github.com/Ookami86/event-sourcing-in-practice)

A talk about [Event Sourcing](http://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html)
I gave, together with [Johannes Seitz](http://www.printhelloworld.de/), at the
[Entwicklertag Frankfurt
2014](http://www.entwicklertag.de/frankfurt/2014/session/event-sourcing-der-praxis)
and the [Developer Week 2014](http://www.developer-week.de/History/2014)


## [Software Craftsmanship or The Agile Hangover](http://static.squeakyvessel.com/slides/what-is-software-craftsmanship_agilerm-ug-20120816.pdf)

A short talk I gave at the local Agile Usergroup on 16-Aug-2012

As the title may suggest, the talk was about Software Craftsmanship and what it
has to do with Agile in general. The outcome is more or less something like "you
need Software Craftsmanship, whether or not you want it and some of the things
you already do are very likely Software Craftsmanship-related".  
There was a lot of head-nodding from the audience, so I guess, they understood
what I was talking about

The [slides](http://static.squeakyvessel.com/slides/what-is-software-craftsmanship_agilerm-ug-20120816.pdf)
are pretty visual, though the (german) notes are very extensive.


## Architectural Katas

At the [2012 SoCraTes](http://www.socrates-conference.de/) I gave
two sessions about [Architectural Katas](http://www.architecturalkatas.com/).

The format was created initially by [Ted Neward](http://www.tedneward.com/) in
response to the lack of practical exercises for software architects. Small
groups solve a given project together (which is similar to a very simple RFP -
    Request for Proposal) in a short amount of time and present it to the other
groups afterwards to "defend" it.

Participants of both sessions were very surprised how hard it is to come up
with a meaningful (or even good) architecture in a short amount of time, and
even more so to convey it to other groups. They also acknowledged the usefulness
to practice this kind of architecting in addition to the usual coding
practices.

As far as I know, it was the first Architectural Kata held in germany.

Later that year, I also facilitated a Architectural Kata session at the
[XPDays DE conference](http://www.xpdays.de/twiki/bin/view/XPDays2012).


## [Soziale Netze Integrieren](http://static.squeakyvessel.com/soziale-netze-integrieren/)

German talk, held at
[web-devcon](http://www.web-developer-conference.de/History/Programm-2011/Soziale-Netze-integrieren)
in Hamburg, Germany on 18-Dec-2011.

> APIs und Mashups sind alte Bekannte für beinahe jeden
> Web-Entwickler. Dennoch hat die Nutzung von APIs erst mit dem Erscheinen
> und dem Erfolg von Google, Twitter und Facebook, den bisher einzigen
> wirklichen "API Billionaires", so richtig begonnen. Die Integration von
> Social Networks mittels ihrer jeweiligen APIs gehört also in den
> Werkzeugkasten jedes ernstzunehmenden Web-Entwicklers. Dieser Vortrag
> behandelt, für was die APIs der Social Networks verwendet werden können,
> welche Herausforderungen bei der Nutzung der APIs bestehen, wie man mit
> Ihnen umgeht und wie am Ende die Architektur der eigenen Anwendung durch
> die Integration von APIs nicht unnötig belastet wird.
