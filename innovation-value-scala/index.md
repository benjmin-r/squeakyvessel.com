The talk first covers how we made our technology
choice at vaamo in favor of Scala. It continues to take a look at the wanted and
unwanted consequences of this choice and closes with my thoughts on how, if at
all, it enabled the team to deliver innovation and value to our business.

### Abstract

Every person's dream in the software industry: A green field project! Starting
from scratch, without any legacy that drags you down! Finally you can do
everything the Right Wayâ„¢ and use all those tools that you've been dreaming
about all along.

Not so long ago, I was able to live that dream.

Turns out, in the real world a green field project is not so easy and shiny as
one might be inclined to think. Even if you can choose from all those shiny and
new toys, I mean tools, making all those choices may not be so straightforward.

In this talk I'll share how and why we, a now medium sized Fintech Startup, made
the choice for Scala and the JVM. I'll talk about how this choice affected our
ability to continuously deliver innovation and value to our business. We'll
touch on what innovation even means for us and also explicitly cover how our
choice of programming language & technology contributes to our ability to
innovate.

  unimportant.
