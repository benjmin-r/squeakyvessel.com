A talk I gave in the Ignite format on 24th October 2014 at the [Berlin DevOps
Days][devopsdays].

In this talk I describe how we share secrets inside the
[vaamo](http://codecraft.vaamo.de) development & operations team, and how we
integrate them into our Chef-based Configuration Management.

You can [watch the video of the talk over at vimeo][video] or take a [look at the
slides][slides], which only give a rough glimpse though, as the original slides
are basically a recording of a longer terminal session.
