### Occasions

A talk I presented at ...

- [Agile Nacht Stuttgart](http://www.mitblick.de/agile-nacht-stuttgart), Germany
  on 24-Oct-2016, with the original title *"Folgen von Agil & Scrum auf die
  Qualität - Ein Realtitätscheck"*


### Abstract

The original question that lead to this talk was asked by [Marco
Klemm](https://twitter.com/marcoklemm), initiator and moderator of [Agile Nacht
Stuttgart](http://www.mitblick.de/agile-nacht-stuttgart). He asked
(paraphrased) "do Agile & Scrum really hold their promise of increasing
a project's quality"?.

In this short talk I present my personal opinion and the experience of my last
years as [CTO of vaamo][codecraft-benjamin]. I argue, that while it's possible to
employ practices such as Agile, Scrum & Software Craftsmanship to increase the
quality of software projects (for varying degrees of quality), the actually
important factors and the biggest leverage to increase quality and success of
projects, are the involved humans and their way of interacting with each other.
