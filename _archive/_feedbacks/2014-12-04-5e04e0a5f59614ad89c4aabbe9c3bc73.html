<p>Hi Benjamin,<br />
I came across your Pontoon git repository in the context of looking for some<br />
examples of bats use to help me learn ow to use this system.<br />
Your testing within Pontoon looks highly comprehensive but precipitated a<br />
realisation about a steep learning curve needed to learn this approach.<br />
Do you have some recommendations you could offer me as to a source of tutorials<br />
or the like for figuring out how to assemble a test-based approach? I'll be starting<br />
with some basic bash scripts. </p>
<p>With thanks in advance</p>
