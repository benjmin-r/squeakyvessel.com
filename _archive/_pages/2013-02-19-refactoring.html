<p>Do you ever find yourself in the situation when:<br />
* Adding new features is very slow because of the existing code?<br />
* Developers complain about architecture and design issues?<br />
* Your teams ask for one month (or more) to refactor the code?</p>
<p>Then it is time to learn how to do refactoring correctly.</p>
<h3>You will learn ...</h3>
<p>At the end of this workshop, you will know how to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do refactoring as a normal part of the development</li>
<li>Never halt production to refactor</li>
<li>Solve architecture and design issues incrementally, based on the current needs</li>
</ul>
<p>You will learn all this, by doing lots of practical exercises, all under the supervision of a very experienced refactorer:<br />
Basic code refactoring techniques<br />
Refactor in baby steps<br />
How to effectively use your IDE for refactoring (only applies to Visual Studio, Visual Studio + ReSharper, Eclipse or IntelliJ Idea. It might apply to other tools who have similar refactoring features.)</p>
