A talk I gave at [Entwicklertag Frankfurt][1] on 24th February 2015.

In the talk I describe five practices, that are directly applicable to a wide
range of teams and circumstances, which can help you lead others.

After describing those "hacks" I lay down the fundamentals of why those
practices work and how you can take your leadership skills to the next level.
