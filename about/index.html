  <img id="aboutimg" style="float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;" src="/static/img/benjamin.jpg" /> My
  name is Benjamin Reitzammer.
</p>


<p>
  Currently I'm a Ruby/Rails developer at <a href="https://github.com/crispymtn">crispymtn</a>,
  working on <a href="https://www.keyline-mis.de/">Keyline</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Before that I was CTO for <a href="https://www.vaamo.de">vaamo</a> where I built the team and technology for the
  first four years of the company, so questions about engineering management, team building and fostering a great
  culture are more than welcome. All in all I have 15+ years of experience across various companies and teams.
</p>

<p>
  Outside of work I spend most of my time with my family, the wonderfullest wife in the world and
  <a href="https://twitter.com/benjamin/status/884450502150324224">two awesome kids</a>.
</p>

<h2>I like &hellip;</h2>

<h3>&hellip; People.</h3>

<p>Especially people getting together to share &amp; learn.</p>

<p>That's why, some (looong) time ago, I started a local <a
    href="https://www.softwerkskammer.org/groups/rheinmain">Software
    Crafter community</a>, kicked off the first <a
    href="http://www.coderetreat-rhein-main.com/">Coderetreats</a> in that area
  as an organizer and facilitator, and for the years 2014 and 2015 I was the main
  organizer of the <a href="http://www.socrates-conference.de/">SoCraTes
    Conference</a>, together with lots of support from fellow <a
    href="https://www.softwerkskammer.org">Softwerkskammer</a>-enthusiasts.</p>

<p>That I like people also makes my job as an Software Developer and occasional Manager so crazily enjoyable.</p>

<h3>&hellip; My Family</h3>

<p>I'm so very grateful to live in a world, where I can afford to spend lots of
  my time with my kids and my wife. They all make me a better and a very happy
  person.</p>

<h3>&hellip; Coffee</h3>

<p>
  <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=from:benjamin%20coffee&src=typd">Simple as that</a>.
</p>

<h3>&hellip; Dotfiles</h3>

<p>
  It's a bit silly, how I still prefer the terminal over many other tools, <a
    href="https://github.com/benjmin-r/dotfiles/tree/master/mutt">I even
    read/write my emails in mutt </a>. So of course I also put my dotfiles <a
    href="https://github.com/benjmin-r/dotfiles">up on GitHub</a> to make my
  working environment slightly portable. They allow me to setup a productive
  working environment on almost any computer that I get access to and therefore
  free me of worrying about my computer breaking.
