  <img style="float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;" src="/static/img/benjamin.jpg" /> My
  name is Benjamin Reitzammer. I'm a Software Developer &amp; Manager from
  Frankfurt/Main, Germany. I take care, that your software projects become the
  success you need them to be.
</p>

<p>Currently I'm in charge of all things technical aka CTO at the
  Frankfurt-based Financial Services Startup <a
    href="https://www.vaamo.de">vaamo</a>. You can read more about our work and
  culture at <a href="http://codecraft.vaamo.de/">our technology blog</a> and my

<h2>I like &hellip;</h2>

<h3>&hellip; People.</h3>

<p>Especially people getting together to share &amp; learn.</p>

<p>That's why, some time ago, I started a local <a
    href="https://www.softwerkskammer.org/groups/rheinmain">Software
    Craftsmanship community</a>, kicked off the first <a
    href="http://www.coderetreat-rhein-main.com/">Coderetreats</a> in that area
  as an organizer and facilitator, and for the years 2014 and 2015 I'm the
  organizer of the <a href="http://www.socrates-conference.de/">SoCraTes
    Conference</a>, together with lots of support from fellow <a
    href="https://www.softwerkskammer.org">Softwerkskammer</a>-enthusiasts.</p>

<p>That I like people also makes my job as an Software Development Manager so
  crazily enjoyable.</p>

<h3>&hellip; My Family</h3>

<p>I'm so very grateful to live in a world, where I can afford to spend lots of
  my time with my kids and my wife. They all make me a better and a very happy
  person.</p>

<h3>&hellip; Coffee</h3>

<p>Simple as that. My fav coffee place is <a
    href="http://kaffeekommune.de/">Paul's Kaffeekommune in Mainz</a>. If
  you've got at least some little time to spare and are remotely in that area,
  then you owe yourself a visit to this awesome place.</p>

<h3>&hellip; Dotfiles</h3>

<p>It's a bit silly, how happy <a
    href="https://github.com/nureineide/dotfiles">those simple files with
    arcane symbols</a> make me. But they give me quite some peace of mind, as
  they allow me to setup a productive working environment on almost any
  computer that I get access to and therefore free me of worrying about my
  computer breaking.</p>
