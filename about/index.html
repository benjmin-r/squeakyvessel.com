  <img id="aboutimg" style="float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;" src="/static/img/benjamin.jpg" /> My
  name is Benjamin Reitzammer. I'm a Software Developer &amp; Manager from
  Frankfurt/Main, Germany. I take care, that your software projects become the
  success you need them to be.

<p>
  Currently I'm working on <a href="http://www.keyline-mis.de/">Keyline</a> with
  the great folks at <a href="http://crispymtn.com/">Crispy Mountain</a>.

<h2>I like &hellip;</h2>

<h3>&hellip; People.</h3>

<p>Especially people getting together to share &amp; learn.</p>

<p>That's why, some time ago, I started a local <a
    href="https://www.softwerkskammer.org/groups/rheinmain">Software
    Craftsmanship community</a>, kicked off the first <a
    href="http://www.coderetreat-rhein-main.com/">Coderetreats</a> in that area
  as an organizer and facilitator, and for the years 2014 and 2015 I'm the
  organizer of the <a href="http://www.socrates-conference.de/">SoCraTes
    Conference</a>, together with lots of support from fellow <a
    href="https://www.softwerkskammer.org">Softwerkskammer</a>-enthusiasts.</p>

<p>That I like people also makes my job as an Software Development Manager so
  crazily enjoyable.</p>

<h3>&hellip; My Family</h3>

<p>I'm so very grateful to live in a world, where I can afford to spend lots of
  my time with my kids and my wife. They all make me a better and a very happy
  person.</p>

<h3>&hellip; Coffee</h3>

<p>Simple as that. My fav coffee place is <a
    href="http://kaffeekommune.de/">Paul's Kaffeekommune in Mainz</a>. If
  you've got at least some little time to spare and are remotely in that area,
  then you owe yourself a visit to this awesome place.</p>

<h3>&hellip; Dotfiles</h3>

<p>
  It's a bit silly, how I still prefer the terminal over many other tools, <a
    href="https://github.com/nureineide/dotfiles/tree/master/mutt">I even
    read/write my emails in mutt </a>. So of course I also put my <a
    href="https://github.com/nureineide/dotfiles">up on GitHub</a> to make my
  working environment slightly portable. They allow me to setup a productive
  working environment on almost any computer that I get access to and therefore
  free me of worrying about my computer breaking.
