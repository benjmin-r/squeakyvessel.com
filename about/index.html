  <img id="aboutimg" style="float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;" src="/static/img/benjamin.jpg" /> My
  name is Benjamin Reitzammer.
</p>


<p>
  Currently I'm a Freelance CTO &amp; Developer. Check out <a href="https://cto.coffee/work-with-me/">how to work with me</a>.
</p>

<p>
  Outside of work I spend most of my time with my family, the wonderfullest wife in the world and
  <a href="https://twitter.com/benjamin/status/884450502150324224">two awesome kids</a>.
</p>

  I enjoy making music with code and <a href="http://sonic-pi.net/">Sonic Pi</a> is my tool of choice there at the

<h2>I like &hellip;</h2>

<h3>&hellip; People.</h3>

<p>Especially people getting together to share &amp; learn.</p>

<p>That's why, some (looong) time ago, I started a local <a
    href="https://www.softwerkskammer.org/groups/rheinmain">Software
    Crafter community</a>, kicked off the first <a
    href="http://www.coderetreat-rhein-main.com/">Coderetreats</a> in that area
  as an organizer and facilitator, and for the years 2014 and 2015 I was the main
  organizer of the <a href="http://www.socrates-conference.de/">SoCraTes
    Conference</a>, together with lots of support from fellow <a
    href="https://www.softwerkskammer.org">Softwerkskammer</a>-enthusiasts.</p>

<p>That I like people also makes my job as an Software Developer and occasional Manager so crazily enjoyable.</p>

<p>
  It's also why I like answering questions from anybody. If you have any question for me,
  <a href="/contact/">contact me</a> or use my <a href="https://github.com/benjmin-r/ama">AMA repo</a> and
  I'll answer your question publicly.
</p>

<h3>&hellip; My Family</h3>

<p>
  I'm so very grateful to live in a world, where I can afford to spend lots of my time with my kids and my wife.
  They all make me a better and a very happy person.
</p>

<h3>&hellip; Coffee</h3>

<p>
  <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=from:benjamin%20coffee&src=typd">Simple as that</a>.
</p>
<p>
  And that's why a podcast, in where I chat with people about people in technology and software development, is aptly named
  <a href="https://cto.coffee">cto.coffee</a>.
